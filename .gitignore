Save the .gitignore file in the root directory of your project.
By including a .gitignore file, you ensure that certain files or directories are not tracked by Git, preventing them from being accidentally committed or shared with others.

It's important to tailor the .gitignore file to your specific project's needs and the files that are not relevant to version control. There are also community-maintained templates available for different project types and programming languages that you can use as a starting point for your .gitignore file.
